# Round end Music

Probably everyone knows what Round end Music is and what it does, but for those who don't, here a simple explanation:

Round end Music is nothing more than an Addon that plays sound files for all Players after the round has endet.
Depending on the Team that has won, specific sound files can be played.

## How do I add music?

Because I don't wanna get in trouble or anything, and I also don't know anybodys music taste, you have to add ALL music files on your own.

How? Pretty ease I'd say.

  1. Go into your addons folder
  2. If you use the Github version of this addon, go into the folder of this addon, otherwise just create a folder with any name that's compatible with gmod and open it.
  3. If not created, create a folder called "sound" and in that folder, create a folder called "roundem".
  4. Create folders depending on the roles you use. Folders have to be written lowercase! Folder name examples:
     - Innocent team: "innocents"
     - Traitor team: "traitors"
     - Jackal team: "jackals"
     - If you wan't to use music for timelimit, call the folder "timelimit".
     - You also need to create a folder called "default". Roles that have no own folder will take music files out of that folder. If this folder does not exist, the addon may error.
  5. Place your sound files in the depending folders.
  6. Finish, the addon will handle the rest (If you use fastdl, you of course have to upload the sound files there too).
